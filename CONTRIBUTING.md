# Contributing to BharatVerse

Welcome to **BharatVerse**, a culturally-rooted AI platform focused on making Indian epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana accessible through AI and open knowledge tools.

We’re a student team working on this as part of the **WikiVerse Hackathon 2025**. Your contributions — whether they’re code, docs, or ideas — are welcome!

---

## 🛠️ How We Work (Team Flow)

* We follow the **GitLab Issue Board** structure
* Every task is created as an **Issue** (with proper labels like `[Feature]`, `[Bug]`, `[Docs]`, etc.)
* Each team member works on a **feature branch**
* Once done, submit a **Merge Request** to `main` with a clear title and description

---

## 👷 Roles & Responsibilities

* **Bhushan** – Prompt Design, UX flow
* **Phani** – Wikidata Integration, API logic
* **Kishore** – Frontend Dev (UI components, visuals)
* **Yashwanth** – Dify AI, model tuning
* **Manoj** – Docs, Timeline Coordination, QA

---

## 🧾 Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/<short-title>       # New feature (e.g., feature/family-tree-svg)
bugfix/<issue-name>        # Bug fixes
docs/<file-or-topic>       # Documentation (e.g., docs/readme-update)
```

---

## 🧠 Commit Style

Use short, semantic commits. Examples:

```bash
feat: add Pandava family tree rendering
fix: correct Krishna character API response
docs: update README with character flow
```

---

## 📥 Merge Requests

* Always open a MR from your branch into `main`
* Add reviewers (at least 1 teammate)
* Ensure no unresolved conflicts
* Link related issues (e.g., Closes #5)

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

* Never push directly to `main`
* Avoid vague commits like `update stuff` or `final changes`
* Don’t merge without at least one review or approval from the team

## ✅ Ready to Contribute?

Start by picking an open issue from the [Issue Board](./-/boards), or open one yourself with a descriptive title and label.
