# 📚 BharatVerse — An Expert of Indian epics!

**BharatVerse** is an interactive AI-powered platform designed to explore Indian history, epics, and cultural legends — like the Mahabharata, Ramayana, and Puranas — using Wikipedia, Wikidata, and open-source language models. The aim is to make the rich legacy of Indian itihaas accessible, understandable, and globally appreciated — without reducing it to just "myth".
